##Playing with two people test

Start game by following technical documentation, connect with two players.
Each player does a move with their viable cards, but don't go outside
the map borders or move into a hole. Both players press ready and wait for the
server to respond.

####Success
- If both players have moved according to the cards they picked and
both players see the same movement, then it is working properly.

####Fail
