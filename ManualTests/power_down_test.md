## Using a power-down token test

Start game by following the technical documentation, playing either in the
single-player or multiplayer mode. Play a round by clicking on "Edit" and
choosing your registers and press "Power Down" **before** pressing "Ready"
(thereby finishing your round). Start the new round by clicking on "Edit"
again.

#### Success
- if the menu where you normally choose your registers contains no cards,
  then you have successfully used the power-down token.

#### Fail
- if the menu contains new cards to choose from, enabling you to play this
  round with no limitations.
